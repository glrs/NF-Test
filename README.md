### Introduction
NF-Test: This pipeline takes some data and does something with it.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

1. [Installation](docs/installation.md)
